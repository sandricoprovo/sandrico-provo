    "I consider myself a career changer. Before I knew what JavaScript was I focused on using my Geography and Sociology degree. I got this degree in January of 2017, and for just over a year I worked as a contract library assistant and a retail store employee. By early 2018 I had moved onto a contract position as a Land Surveying Assistant which was more related to my degree, but after a few months of working this job and looking at my other options I realized I needed a change. My coding journey started in the summer of 2018 when I bought my first MacBook. The first two things I did was download Visual Studio Code and buy a programming course on Udemy so I could start learning. At this point I was still working full time, so I would get up at 5am Monday through Friday to work on the course before my day job started. After a few months I had finished the course, and by this point I knew coding was going to be my career. Knowing I wanted to make this switch into tech, I applied and got into NSCC's two year IT Web Programming course. In this course I learned about frontend and backend technologies, best practices, problem solving, and other topics. All the while I was still building small projects in my free time that interested me or solved a problem I had. Fast forward to today I'm in industry, solving problems daily, and writing quality production code. I think peoples' stories can say a lot about them. If my story sounds interesting to you and you'd like to connect to chat more about it, or if you think I might be a fit for an opportunity you have please reach out via my contact page.";
